							<p>I am currently working on a solar flare detector, which works on an interesting change in refractivity of the Earth's ionosphere. Check out the Solar Flare Detector project for more information.</p>
							<p>In the future, I would like this website to carry tutorials on subjects ranging from electronic fundamentals to design, physics and anything that might interest people. If you have any ideas, please feel free to contact me when I get the website fully operational.</p>
