							the complexity and cost of the system) if does not offer much flexibility once it has been created. Plasma antennas offer greater flexibility, as well as electrically adjustable characteristics such as impedance, resonant frequency, gain, etc.</p></td>

					<td valign="top"><td bgcolor="696969"><p>Plasma antennas work on exactly the same principles as their metal counterparts, the obvious difference being the material they are constructed from. Normally, a column of plasma in generated under low pressure, and an RF signal is 
							either inductively or capacitively coupled to the column, which radiates comparably to its metallic counterpart. It is the 'soup' of charged particles, rather than 'mobile' electrons which allow the plasma antenna to operate. It is quite clear, therefore, 
							that the plasma must be sustained in order for such an antenna to work, which requires the use of a seperate power supply. In this regard, a plasma antenna can be thought of as an 'active' antenna. As wih active components such as Op Amps, if the supply is 
							removed the antenna will cease to function, and will simply appear electrically invisible.</p>
							<p>This is not nessercarily a bad thing. In stealth applications, it can be very useful to conceal antennas from the likes of RADAR. With plasma antennas, they need only to be electrically visible during transmit and receive, offering clear advantages over 
							ever visible metallic antennas. In civil applications, large arrays of, for example, mobile phone arrays can be vastly reduced in size by nestling antennas within one another. When the internal antenna is required to transmit, the external antenna can be 
							switched off, allowing the interal antenna to transmitt and recieve as if no physical barrier were present. This characteristic allows for tighter arrays, where unoperational antennas do not affect the characteristics of nearby antennas.</p>
							<p>Plasma frequency describes oscillations of the plasma density which give rise to another interesting characteristic. By considering Nyquist's theorem, it can be deduced that the plasma will not couple with RF signals above the inherit oscillations within 
							itself. RF of frequency greater than the plasma frequency will appear to simply pass through the antenna. This has obvious electronic counter measure applications, as jamming signals can be allowed to pass through the antenna, providing the are of a greater 
							frequency. Plasma frequency is given by Equation 1. It should be noted that the equivalent plasma frequency of metallic antennas is far into the terahertz range.</p>

					<td valign="top"><td bgcolor="696969"><p>Other, more exotic applications for plasma antennas include creating a plasma antenna by coupling signals to the plasma formed around aircraft during hypersonic flight. By it's nature, the plasma would severly attenuate signals to and from the 
						 	aircraft. Using the plasma which forms during hypersonic flight and reverting back to convetional metallic antennas during sub-hypersonic flight allows for a solution to be found. Ion engines, which are gaining popularity in space probes are a source of plasma which, by 
							nature of the operation of ion engines, is sustained for large portions of the flight. Why waste mass on big, bulky antennas (which can interfer with sensitive measurement), when a plasma antenna could be strapped to the engine, and only electrically visible when it is needed? 
							Figure 2 shows a prototype engine, begging for an antenna to be integrated on it.</p>

					<td valign="top"><td bgcolor="696969"><p>Despite the innovation with using plasma as the material of the antenna, most (if not all) research has been done useing repourposed flouresecnt lights. Whilst allowing for a quick and easy means of testing some basic antenna types, it is not the most 
							flexible setup for measuring the effects of parameters such as the gas type, pressure, flow, electrode sizes and shapes, etc. I have been working for several months on a proof of concept setup, which should allow for easy manipulation of the antenna's component parts, as well 
							as offering a much 'roomier' plasma chamber, to allow for magnetic manipulation of the plasma within. The built setup can be seen in Figure 3.</p>
							<p>I presented my theory and design to a panel of three judges at the local heat of the IET's Present Around the World competition, where I won first place. In the second round, I took second place, with which I am very happy. I have since used the prize money to buy materials
							to build the antenna (including helium to ionise), a HV supply and a vaccuum pump. More details to follow regarding this aspect.</p>
							<p>I have plans to write a couple of papers based off of the results of the proof of concept alone. The use of a plasma in a shape other than a cylinder seems to be a first, which should proove most exciting to investigate. Not only is the spherical shape of the antenna of 
							interest, but also the flexibility it offers in terms of plasma manipulation. Again, I have not seen papers which refer to magnetic manipulation of the plasma. It is my hope to get the proof of concept working within the next couple of years. It is currently sitting in a box, 
							ready to be tested until that time comes. Once I am happy with the proof of concept, I hope to be able to explore more refined designs.</p>
							<p>More to follow.</p>
